              <h2>Muscle Awareness Sonification System for Digital Artists</h2>
              <p>
                This is a system that was aimed to reduce muscle stress and
                tension reduction for people working at their desk, particularly
                for digital artists, who typically work at their desks for long
                periods of time. The system supported tasks such as sonifiying
                data about how hard artists are gripping their digitizer pens or
                stylus to remind users to reduce their pen grip to prevent
                cramping and hand fatigue.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another task that the system supported was sonifying data about
                the user’s posture to remind users to straighten up and fix
                their posture. The system will also supported sonifying data
                about where the users is mainly drawing from (shoulder vs wrist)
                to reduce wrist overuse and prevent injury
              </p>
              <p>
                This project used Wizard of Oz prototyping using a control
                interface program written in Java using Processing, ControlP5,
                and the Beads library.
              </p>
              <p>
                There was no visual component for the user -- rather auditory
                sounds were used to communicate data.

              <h2>The Problem</h2>
              <p>
                Many digital artists typically work for long hours at their
                desks, using digitizer devices to draw in digital software
                environments like Photoshop and Clip Studio Paint.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some current frustrations with the current drawing experience
                for digital artists are physical injuries, chronic pain, and
                possibly even a loss of their ability to continue their job. In
                2015, Yuumei, a popular artist on the platform Deviantart, had
                posted a blog post talking about how she destroyed her body by
                drawing without taking care of her general health.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, if an artist’s movements were sonified to allow the
                users to be more aware of their body and their sitting posture,
                it could benefit the artist and help reduce the risk of injury,
                which tends to be common in the artist community.

              <h2>User Persona</h2>

              <p>
                Meet Emma (25). Emma is a fulltime freelance artist who uses
                both an iPad and a Wacom Cintiq to complete her artworks. She
                works from home and spends a lot of time sitting at her desk
                drawing for several hours a day. <br /><br />
              </p>

              <p>Problems:</p>
              <p>
                Lately Emma has been feeling some pain in her body while
                drawing. Her hands have been hurting from griping her digitizer
                pen too hard and her lower back has been aching a bit from
                sitting for so much. She tries to be mindful of her posture and
                her pen pressure while drawing, but soon forgets and falls back
                into her old back habits after a several minutes. Emma has heard
                from her artist friends about the dangers of repetitive strain
                injury (RSI) and other complications and wants to fix her bad
                habits quickly so that she doesn’t damage her body further.

              <h2>Scenarios</h2>
              <p>Scenario 1: Reducing Pen Grip</p>

              <p>
                Emma is a freelance artist who draws for several hours at her
                desk each day using her iPad and Wacom Cintiq. Lately, she
                notices that her hand gets very tired when she draws and finds
                that she can’t draw without her hand quickly cramping up.
                Talking with her doctor, she finds that she has a bad habit of
                tightly gripping her pen, causing her hand to cramp up and tire
                quickly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Emma wants to fix this habit to help prevent herself from
                getting injured any further. She tries to be mindful when
                drawing and reduce her pen grip, but after a couple of moments
                she inadvertently reverts back to her bad habit. Emma learns
                about a new sonification system that can alert her with a loud
                sound when she’s gripping her pen too hard. When Emma reduces
                her pen grip, the loud sound disappears. When Emma is gripping
                her pen a little too hard, she hears a warning message that
                let’s her know that she should slightly reduce her pen grip.
              </p>

              <br />
              <p>Scenario 2: Improving Posture</p>

              <p>
                Emma is a freelance artist who draws for several hours at her
                desk each day using her iPad and Wacom Cintiq. Lately, she
                notices that some pain and discomfort in her back and neck and
                finds that the pain increases after drawing for a few hours.
                Talking with her doctor, she finds that she has poor sitting
                posture, causing the discomfort in her back and neck.
              </p>
              <p>
                Emma wants to fix this habit to help prevent herself from
                getting injured any further. She tries to be mindful when
                drawing and maintain good posture, but after a couple of moments
                she inadvertently reverts back to her bad habit. Emma learns
                about a new sonification system that can alert her with a loud
                buzzing sound when her posture is bad. When Emma slouches, the
                system plays a loud sound to alert her to readjust her posture.
                If Emma’s neck slouches forwards, another differnt loud sound is
                played to alert her.
              </p>

              <br />
              <p>Scenario 3: Reduce Wrist Overuse</p>
              <p>
                Emma is a freelance artist who draws for several hours at her
                desk each day using her iPad and Wacom Cintiq. Lately, she
                notices that some pain and discomfort in wrist and finds that
                she can no longer draw for long periods of time without pain
                issues. Talking with her doctor, she finds that she has been
                overusing her wrist, causing the pain in her wrist.
              </p>
              <p>
                Emma wants to fix this habit to help prevent herself from
                getting injured any further. She tries to be mindful when
                drawing and tries to draw mostly from her shoulder, but after a
                couple of moments she inadvertently reverts back to her bad
                habit of drawing from her wrist. Emma learns about a new
                sonification system that can alert her with a loud sliding sound
                when she does not draw mainly from her shoulder. When Emma draws
                primarily from her wrist, the system plays a loud sliding sound
                to alert her to draw from her shoulder. If Emma draws properly
                from her shoulder, the sound disappears.

              <h2>Testing</h2>

              <p>
                In order to test the system, user tests were conducted using
                student digital artists who used Wacom-like digitizer devices to
                draw digitally. Three digital artists were recruited for this
                user test. Due to the current pandemic, all user tests were done
                remotely through the use of Discord’s video call function.
              </p>

              <p>
                Unfortunately, this means that during some user tests, technical
                problems have occurred, such as video calls freezing and sound
                cutting out from time to time. Other shortcomings were that I
                was unable to recruit professional or non-student hobbyist
                artists, not having a larger user testing pool, and not having
                the ability to actually measure and gather data from the
                participant as they tested the system.
              </p>

              <p>
                Participants were asked to access a special link to aggie.io, an
                online collaborative drawing site, and were asked to do their
                drawings for the duration of the whole user testing here.
                Training was split into three parts: training for grip pressure,
                training for posture, and training for wrist awareness. Training
                for posture was further split into to portions: training for
                keeping good posture and training for keeping the head/neck in
                good position.

              <h2>Results</h2>

              <p>
                From the data gathered, it’s clear that none of the participants
                thought that the sounds were enjoyable. In fact, all of them
                commented that the sounds should be changed to something more
                pleasant. Even one even commented how audio may not be a
                suitable way to express the data as many artists like to listen
                to podcasts or music as they draw and that such a system could
                detract to that experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                Artists need to be in a creative environment to draw and create
                their work, and from the results, it’s clear that the system
                needs a bit of work to make the sonifications enjoyable and
                promote a creative space.
              </p>
              <p>
                This also brings up a question of whether or not audio is a good
                medium into translating the data. If artists need to have a
                creative environment in which music and podcasts are being
                listened, how can the sonifications not break that environment?
                Or would it be more beneficial if that data got translated into
                tactile feedback instead?
              </p>

                The current design of the study involves having researcher
                verbally give commands to the participants as it’s impossible to
                visually see things like how hard someone is gripping their pen
                without sensor data. As a result, this may be stressing
                participants into focusing on the wrong thing – they may be too
                focused on listening to the instructions given that they may not
                be paying enough attention to the system itself.

                More surprisingly, is the realization that some artists are
                indifferent to improving their posture, preferring their poor
                posture and habits even if it may harm them in the long run.
                Overall, the data gathered from the user tests conducted with
                this system are inconclusive, but point to more questions that
                need to be anwered about the system and it's core design.
