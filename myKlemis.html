            <h2>MyKlemis App</h2>
            <p>
              The MyKlemis App is a working application built for Georgia Tech's on campus food pantry, 
              Klemis Kitchen, as part of the Junior Design class sequence. Klemis Kitchen aims to serve 
              as an alternate source of meals for students who have special dietary needs or are experiencing  
              financial concerns that cause them to be food insecure.
            </p>

            <p>
              As of now, Klemis Kitchen currently does not have an application or an inventory management system 
              that both students and admins can use to keep track of what items are available. Furthermore, 
              Klemis Kitchen plans to open new outposts locations across campus and this can be difficult  without 
              some sort of app or way to keep organized about the inventory across the locations.
            </p>

            <p>
              The MyKlemis App helps fill this gap by allowing admins and students to be able to easily view Klemis 
              Kitchen’s entire inventory and also allows admins an easier way to help keep track and make changes to the inventory.

            <h2>Brainstorming &amp; Research</h2>
            <p>
              We started off with brainstorming our possible users for the application and grouping them into general groups. 
              The team came up with five possible users:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Procurement: users who help to gather or donate items for Klemis Kitchen
              </li>
              <li>
                Consumers: users, such as students, who use Klemis Kitchen to obtain items
              </li>
              <li>
                Management: users such as admins and faculty who manage Klemis Kitchen
              </li>
              <li>
                Giving Back: users such as volunteers who help Klemis Kitchen, but aren’t admins
              </li>
              <li>
                Unintended Usage: free riders/ people who don’t need use Klemis Kitchen
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The last user group, Unintended Usage was scrapped as the team felt that it didn’t make much sense.
              Our team then went and conducted literature reviews for the four possible user groups we had.

            <h2>Prototyping &amp; Design</h2>
            
            <p>
              When we first began sketching wireframes and possible screens, we mistakenly believed that the application would 
              have a login for both administrators and students, and that students could add food items to a cart and “check” 
              them out using the app. We also planned for a chat feature that would allow students to discuss problems and food 
              items with administrators, as well as a home landing page that would serve as a notice board holding announcements 
              on upcoming deliveries as well as low food amounts.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

            <img src="assets/img/KlemisPaperPT.JPG" alt="Image" class="img-fluid">

            <br/>
            <p>Some initial designs we had before the team realized changes needed to be made. You can see how students were also originally
              meant to log in and be able to check out food items, but this feature was scrapped for privacy concerns.
            </p>

        <div class="row mb-4 align-items-center">
          <div class="col-md-auto" data-aos="fade-up">
            <br/>
            <p>It wasn’t until the team got to physically tour Klemis Kitchen’s facilities that we realized our current design didn’t fit the client’s 
              actual needs and that it needed to go through some changes. The team’s understanding of how Klemis Kitchen operated was much different 
              from how it actually operated, and we realized that we were focusing on the wrong things for the app. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Our literature review also revealed that <a href= "#section1">according to a small survey conducted at UNT, the majority of the food insecure participants 
              stated they would use a campus food pantry, but also expressed fear about being seen by other fellow students and the need for privacy. </a>
            </p>

            <p>
              To ensure privacy, we removed the student login, and allowed anyone to view Klemis Kitchen’s inventory. A separate login was made for admins 
              to be able to make edits and announcements. The chat idea was scrapped in favor of an email form that users could use to get in touch with 
              Klemis Kitchen admins.

            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>Programming was done in five three-week sprints with team members assigned to work on specific tasks during each sprint.
              The final app was programmed using Xamarin with an Amazon Web Services (AWS) backend in addition to Klemis Kitchen's own backend. 
              I helped work on the front end of the app, and helped to program several of the app screens.
